QPath traffic simulator is a tool for Unity Engine that allows you to create a street layout and simulate the traffic on it.

Building a street layout is very quick. Junctions and their traffic lights are created automatically based on the number of connected streets and their lanes. The vehicles leave their designated homes for work, shops, or just passing by the city, making city traffic more reliable. The A * algorithm makes cars go to a specific destination and try to avoid traffic jams.

The project, along with videos showing how it works, is available on the Asset Store:
